# üçè Web Developer Mac setup

## This script automates the setup of a new Mac environment by:

- Checking for Homebrew: If not installed, it installs Homebrew, then updates it.
- Installing key Homebrew packages: It installs essential tools like Git, Python, and Zsh.
- Managing Node.js via NVM: Installs NVM (Node Version Manager) and installs the latest LTS version of Node.js.
- Optional installations: Prompts the user to install additional tools like Spotify, Stats, Rectangle, Hiddenbar, Oh-My-Zsh and some of the most popular Python libraries such as virtualenv, requests, numpy, and pandas.

### In short, the script streamlines configuring both essential and optional tools for your Mac development setup.
